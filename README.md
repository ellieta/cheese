<center> the origins </center>
It was *really* not that big of a deal at first. It all began one day in Ms. Perry's 9th grade bio class, when she asked what my favorite snack was. Caught off guard, I said **I really like sliced cheese**." My friends, of course, joked around about it, mocking me. It wasn't a big deal until I actually began incoporating cheese into my daily life. And now we have reached this point.

 ### the developments 
Cheese slowly became a default to everything I did. It infiltrated my Valorant username, my profile pictures, my lock screen, my clothes, my cups. 
 #### exhibit a: the valorant username 
After downloading Valorant one day, I figured, what is the most ironically silly username I can come up with? And boom, notcheesyXD was born.

 ##### my other accounts 
I only have one another account, but here are some of the other names I could have/would have gone with 
- cheesypopcorn
- thatsacheesyjoke
- yourcheesyfriendXD
 #### exhibit b: my discord profile picture 
My friends and I think matching profile pictures are, what the internet calls, cringe. But given that we call every day, we wanted our profile pictures to somewhat blend together nicely (at least color wise) so we could have something pretty to look at during our 9pm discord calls.

We change the color of our profile pictures every few months, often based on holidays.

 ### exhbit c: personal items 
My friends caught onto the whole theme of me liking cheese, and they began gifting me a lot of cheese-related things.

 ## the end 
That is all! As you can see, cheese became a hilariously large part of my life, and is now even something I can write about!
